## Fountain Challenge

### Project Description

The goal of the test task is to create a simple TODO application. A user should be able to Add tasks, Edit tasks, Complete tasks and Undo them. Everything is exposed in the mockup. Feel free to ask additional questions directly in Figma.

- We expect you to use React and Redux with any additions to accomplish this task.
- It's not necessary to store application state. It's ok just to reset the whole thing after the page reload.
- No additional screens like user authentication are required. 
- It'll be good to see the application deployed somewhere but it's not strictly necessary. At least, there should be any instructions to run the code locally.
- The app should be mobile-friendly.

### To run the application

Fork a copy from github or download the repository on your computer, unzip it and launch the terminal at the root directory of the folder.

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependency to your local machine.
2. Run `npm run build-dev` to compile with webpack.
3. Open another tab at your terminal.
4. Run `npm run start-dev` to start live server.
